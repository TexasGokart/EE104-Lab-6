----------[(Convolutional Neural Network)]----------

***REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES***
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

***ABOUT THIS CODE***
This code trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model has been trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 25.



----------[(Challenge Test)]----------

***REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES***
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pathlib
import certifi
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

***ABOUT THIS CODE*** 
This code uses an image classification model from the CIFAR10 dataset to make predictions of what five input images are showing and display the respective class label for each image.


----------[(Happy Garden Game)]----------

***REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES***
import pgzrun
import pygame
import pgzero
from random import randint
from pgzero.builtins import Actor
import time

***ABOUT THIS CODE***
This code is a game where a cow needs to water flowers in a garden to prevent them from wilting. If a flower is left to wilt for too long, they become fangflowers that move around to attack the cow. The game ends if too many flowers wilt or if the cow comes into contact with a fangflower.



----------[(Hello World to OpenAI)]----------

***REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES***
import os
import openai
from flask import Flask, redirect, render_template, request, url_for

***ABOUT THIS CODE***
This code sets up an HTML template that allows the user to input a creature or object and generates four superhero names for that creature or object using the OpenAI API.



----------[(Hello World to ChatGPT)]----------

***REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES***
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

***ABOUT THIS CODE***
This code uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to a user input prompt continuously until prompted to stop with "quitme". The engine, prompt, max tokens, number of responses, stop condition, and temperature parameters can all be modified to affect the output of the chatbot.
